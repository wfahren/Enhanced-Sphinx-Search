# Enhanced Sphinx Search with Phrase Highlighting

This repository contains a Sphinx documentation site with enhanced search functionality that supports both exact phrase matching and multi-term searches with intelligent highlighting.

## Features

### üîç **Smart Search Types**

| Search Input | Behavior | Example |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `single word` | Treats as exact phrase | `openvpn` ‚Üí finds pages containing "openvpn" |
| `multiple words` | Treats as exact phrase | `openvpn server` ‚Üí finds pages with "openvpn server" phrase |
| `"quoted text"` | Exact phrase search | `"public key"` ‚Üí finds pages with exact phrase |
| `word1, word2` | Multiple terms (AND logic) | `openvpn, server` ‚Üí finds pages with BOTH words |
| `word1, word2, word3` | All terms required | `key, server, config` ‚Üí finds pages with ALL words |
| `""` | **Clear highlights** | `""` ‚Üí clears all highlighting from pages |

## Installation

### Requirements

- Sphinx documentation generator
- Any Sphinx theme (tested with Read the Docs theme)
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: When opening HTML files directly in a browser using `Ctrl+O` or the `file://` protocol, JavaScript functionality is limited by browser security policies. The enhanced search features may not work properly. For full functionality, serve the documentation through a web server (even a local one like `python -m http.server`).

### Setup

1. **Add the search enhancement script** to your Sphinx project:

   ```text
   source/_static/js/search-phrase.js
   ```

2. **Update your `conf.py`** to include the script:

   ```python
   html_js_files = [
       'js/search-phrase.js',
       # ... your other JS files
   ]
   ```

3. **Build your documentation**:

   ```bash
   make clean && make html
   ```

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The enhancement uses a **wrapper approach** that:

- Preserves all original Sphinx functionality
- Adds phrase search capabilities on top
- Avoids conflicts with existing JavaScript
- Works with any Sphinx theme that doesn't override the search system

### Files Structure

```text
source/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _static/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ search-phrase.js    # Enhanced search wrapper
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conf.py                     # Sphinx configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                         # Your documentation files
```

### How It Works

1. **Search Interception**: Wraps the original `Search.query` function
2. **Query Processing**: Analyzes input to determine search type (phrase vs. multi-term)
3. **Content Filtering**: Fetches and analyzes page content to verify phrase/term presence
4. **Result Display**: Shows filtered results using original Sphinx display functions
5. **Highlighting**: Applies custom highlighting on destination pages via localStorage

## Usage Examples

```text
openvpn                    # Find pages about OpenVPN
"public key infrastructure" # Find exact phrase
server configuration       # Find "server configuration" phrase
```

### Multi-term Searches

```text
openvpn, server           # Pages with both "openvpn" AND "server"
key, certificate, config  # Pages with all three terms
public, private, key      # Pages discussing all key types
```

### Advanced Examples

```text
"elliptic curve", RSA     # Exact phrase + additional term
configuration, setup      # Multiple related terms
"step by step"            # Exact instructional phrase
```

### Clear Highlighting

```text
""                        # Clear all highlighting from pages
```

## Customization

### Styling

The highlighting uses this CSS class:

```css
.highlighted {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

You can customize the appearance by adding CSS rules to your theme.

### Theme Compatibility

This enhancement should work with any Sphinx theme that:

- Uses the standard Sphinx search system
- Doesn't completely override the `Search` object
- Supports custom JavaScript files via `html_js_files`

**Tested themes:**

- Read the Docs theme ‚úÖ
- Basic Sphinx theme ‚úÖ
- Most standard themes ‚úÖ

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Search enhancement not working**
A: Check that `search-phrase.js` is loaded and there are no JavaScript console errors

**Q: Search doesn't work when opening files directly (file:// protocol)**
A: This is expected due to browser security restrictions. Use one of these solutions:

- Serve through a web server: `python -m http.server 8000` then visit `http://localhost:8000`

**Q: Multi-term search not working**
A: Verify you're using commas to separate terms: `term1, term2, term3`

**Q: Phrase search giving wrong results**
A: Check if quotes are needed for exact phrase matching: `"exact phrase"`

## Changelog
